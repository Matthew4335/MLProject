<h2 id="introductionbackground">Introduction/Background</h2>

<p>This project will predict the NBA’s annual MVP and DPOY awards, as well as the All-NBA and All-Defensive Team selections. Previous studies have explored the use of machine learning methods to forecast specific game outcomes [1], forecast future NBA rosters [2], and even forecast which college players will perform best in the NBA [3]. However, our project intends to predict end of season awards across the entire NBA through analyzing player statistics and team performances. By doing so, we contribute to the field of sports analytics and machine learning, offering insights into the NBA’s prestigious end of season awards.</p>

<p>In order to achieve this, we will need a dataset of player and team stats from previous NBA seasons, and the winners of the awards at the end of those seasons. We will use a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumitrodatta/nba-aba-baa-stats/data">Kaggle NBA dataset</a>, which encompasses detailed regular-season statistics of NBA players since the 1950s. This dataset includes player statistics such as points per game, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, and yearly team records.</p>

<h2 id="problem-definition">Problem Definition</h2>
<p>Our project’s primary problem is the subjective nature of NBA award selections and team nominations. Despite the availability of player performance data, the current selection process involves human judgment, which can overlook the statistical contributions of players throughout the season. This subjectivity leads to inconsistencies in award selections.
By leveraging ML algorithms to analyze team and player statistics, we aim to develop a model that can identify patterns that correlate with award selections and team nominations to solve this problem. This approach provides a transparent method for award/team selection.</p>
